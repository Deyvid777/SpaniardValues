  <h3>What is the "closest match" in the results?</h3>
      <p>Like 8 values, this test tries to match it with more characteristic political ideologies of Spain. All of this is currently W.I.P. </p>
  <h3>I don't like my results!</h3>
      <p>This test is not 100% accurate, so if you have any complaint, be it a coding error or dislike with the assigned result, please let my Discord know which is Deyvid#8195. </p>
